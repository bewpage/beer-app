The `findMembersToBill` function takes an array of `Member` objects and returns an object with three properties: `billable`, `dependents`, and `circularReferences`. Here's what each part does:

### Types

- `Member`: Represents a member with `id`, `name`, and `linkId` properties. The `linkId` represents the parent of the member.

### Purpose

- `billable`: Contains members who are to be billed.
- `dependents`: Maps each billable member's ID to an array of their dependents (children).
- `circularReferences`: Contains IDs of members involved in circular references.

### Implementation Details

1. **Filter Parents and Children**: Members with `linkId` as `null` are considered parents, and the rest are considered children.

    ```javascript
    const parents: Member[] = members.filter(m => m.linkId === null);
    const children: Member[] = members.filter(m => m.linkId !== null);
    ```

2. **Detect Circular References**: If any member's `linkId` forms a loop back to any member along the parent chain, it's a circular reference.

    ```javascript
    // Set to detect circular references
    const circularRefs: Set<number> = new Set();
    ```

   The function uses the `getNextMember` helper to traverse from child to parent, and uses `currentPath` to keep track of the members it has visited. If it encounters a member it has already visited, it's a circular reference.

3. **Filter Billable Members**: Parents without circular references are billable.

    ```javascript
    const billable = parents.filter(parent => !circularRefs.has(parent.id));
    ```

4. **Map Parents to Their Dependents**: For each billable parent, it maps them to their children (dependents).

    ```javascript
    const dependents: Map<number, Member[]> = new Map();
    parents.forEach(parent => {
        dependents.set(
            parent.id,
            children.filter(child => child.linkId === parent.id)
        );
    });
    ```

### For the Given Data Object

- **billable**: Members with IDs `[4, 5, 11]` are billable.
- **dependents**:
    - Member with ID `4` has no dependents.
    - Member with ID `5` has no dependents.
    - Member with ID `11` has no dependents.
- **circularReferences**: Members with IDs `[1, 2, 3]` form a circular reference, and Member with ID `10` forms a self-circular reference.

The function performs all these calculations and returns an object containing `billable`, `dependents`, and `circularReferences`.
